# Learning Complex Spectral Mapping with Gated Convolutional Recurrent Networks for Monaural Speech Enhancement

This repository provides an implementation of the gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN) for monaural speech enhancement, developed in ["Learning complex spectral mapping with gated convolutional recurrent networks for monaural speech enhancement"](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~wang.77/papers/Tan-Wang.taslp20.pdf), IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing, vol. 28, pp. 380-390, 2020.

## Requirements
The program is developed using Python 3.7. Dependencies can be installed by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
