# Learning Complex Spectral Mapping with Gated Convolutional Recurrent Networks for Acoustic Echo Cancellation in an Ambisonics Sound reproduction system.

This repository builds on the gated convolutional recurrent network (GCRN) originally published [here](https://github.com/JupiterEthan/GCRN-complex.git).
While the latter aims at speech enhancement of noisy signals, this repository is furthermore inspired by [this paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/app13031266) on acoustic echo cancellation in a surround sound setup.
